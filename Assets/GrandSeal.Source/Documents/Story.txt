Far of the Mainland lies Grans Island. The Island was once inhabited by those
who called themselves the Ancients. Great Scientists and Powerfull Sorcerer's.
The Mainland far to the East of Grans was occupied by Humans and Monsters.
There was the Kingdom of Karatu which had the Strongest Swordsmen.
There also where the Priests of Wruun and the Mages of Ktar.
Those three Kingdoms formed the Alliance that Ruled the Mainland.
But beside the Peace there Was a Kingdom of Evil. It's location was on an Island
in the Northern Region. It was the Kingdom of Rune. Once it was part of the
Mainland Alliance and famous for it's weapons.

One Day The Ancients vanished from the Face of the Earth. Leaving
the Island of Grans without Guard. And so it happened that Humans
Invaded the Sacred island of Grans.
