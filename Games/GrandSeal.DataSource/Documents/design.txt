Main Class inheritance, if possible the basic main classes should be seperate threads

- Graphics
- Sound
- Input
- Game
- Space	-> Planet	-> Field	-> Battle
					-> Cutscene

	-> Mothership	-> Arcade

	// Possible additions (just thoughts)
	-> Orion style build-em up and mining posts etc etc
	-> RTS Style space combat thing etc etc
	nearly endless possibilities




Main Class Description:
Space
	Space is the Hub for all Player action, from here the player either visits planets and enters FF-Mode
	or goes into arcade style space combat action.

Planet
	This is FF-Mode planet like travel as in FF8/9
	Try and make these as random as possible except story related maps/planets.
	Monsters are randomly encountered and spread by planetary level zones and area-types

Field
	FF-Style Scenes like citys and story related areas, more detailed than the map
	maybe some of them can be random generated to an extend like cities or something

Battle
	FF-Style Battle in the classical Console type

Cutscene
	Either ingame or FMV

Mothership
	This is the space operation central of the squad and where all the ships are kept
	this has to be quite large
	From here all the Arcade missions are launched

Arcade
	Tyrian style space shoot-em-up in some nice 3d graphics



Multiplayer Ideas
	- Form Teams of max 4 people, each member can than bring in as much members as players in team to a max of 4 players
		ex:
			2 Players = 2 Player/ships each
			4 Players = 1 Player/ship each

	     Which character is selected is done at the same places you can do it normally and during team formation
	- Teams can engage missions together and explore planets

Misc Ideas
	- Switch characters/ships during combat/arcade
	- inactive ships are shown under the current ship, only one ship can be active at a time
	  in arcade you can only switch with ships in your active ship squad
	- Self expanding Randomized/constant universe with build in constants for story and fixed points
	- Enemys have items you can steal to craft with or whatever
	- Exp goes into pool for non-active player characters, can redeem pool while played
